* logging
#+begin_quote
- you configure ZMK to spit logging over a USB basically, so when ZMK boots it drops a serial port device onto the compute rwhich you can read using minicom or tio etc.
- On the topic of logging, you may also need initialization logging because you're going to be writing a driver.  If my memory serves me correctly, that __might__ be before USB logging is fully initialized?  I'm not sure.  I know it has an option to be started early, but I don't remember the fine print.  If so, you'll need to use other debugging tech such as SWO (there's several options, they usually require a tool * worth reading around the topic).
- I personally use a Pi with openocd over GPIO bitbashing * but it's not the most reliable and I'm going to buy or make a tool.
