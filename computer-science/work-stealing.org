#+title: work stealing
#+filetags: computer-science

- in parallel computing, work stealing is a scheduling strategy for multithreaded computer programs
- tasks are being continiously split and shared by threads
  - once thread completes it's task, it either goes back to its list of remaining tasks, or goes fishing (stealing) work from other's threads lists
