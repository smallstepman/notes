#+title: test double

- a generic (meta) term used for objects or procedures
  - frequently, the final release software consists of a complex set of objects or procedures interacting together to create the final result
  - in automated unit testing, it may be necessary to use objects or procedures that look and behave like their release-intended counterparts, but are actually simplified versions that reduce the complexity and facilitate testing
