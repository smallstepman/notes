#+title: synchronous interface

- from Rust for rustaceans
#+begin_quote
Synchronous interfaces hide all this waiting; the application calls a function that says “write these bytes to this file,” and some time
later, that function completes and the next line of code executes. Behind the scenes, what really happens is that the operating system
queues up a write operation to the disk and then puts the application to sleep until the disk reports that it has finished the write. The
application experiences this as the function taking a long time to execute, but in reality it isn’t really executing at all, just waiting.
