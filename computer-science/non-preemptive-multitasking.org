#+title: non-preemptive multitasking

- a task itself decides when the CPU would be better off doing something else than waiting for something to happen in the current task
- commonly this is done by yielding control to the scheduler
  - when the control is yielded a central scheduler direct the CPU to resume work on another task that is ready to actually do something else than just block
- a normal use case for this is to yield control when something that will block execution occurs
  - an example of this is IO operations
