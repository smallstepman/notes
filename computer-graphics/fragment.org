#+title: fragment

- a unit of rendering work affecting at most a single output pixel
- a "potential pixel"
  - when line is rasterized, you end up with some pixel-like data. If, however, part of that line is hidden behind something else, some of those fragments won't ever be shown on screen, so they won't ever become pixels
  - You might also have (for example) a line that's partially transparent, so it'll be blended with whatever's behind it before it gets shown on screen.
  - To give a slightly different perspective, however, DirectX terms all of these as pixels, whether they ever get shown on screen or not
- Pixel shaders, also known as:
  - fragment shaders,
  - compute color and
  - other attributes of each "fragment"
