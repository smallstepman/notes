#+title: file descriptor

- a unique identifier (handle) for a file or other input/output resource, such as a pipe or network socket
- file descriptors typically have non-negative integer values, with negative values being reserved to indicate "no value" or error conditions
- file descriptors are a part of the POSIX API
* POSIX API
each Unix process (except perhaps daemons) should have three standard POSIX file descriptors, corresponding to the three standard streams:
- =0= Standard input
- =1= Standard output
- =2= Standard error
