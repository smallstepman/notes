- from the perspective of a program the primary thing which defines an operating system is what system calls it makes available
- system calls are functions in the operating system code, which programs can invoke using special instruction
- these functions are the primary means by which the operating system exposes functionality to programs so that programs can use features or hardware like say read and write data on a storage device or send or receive data across the network
- ways to access the kernel
