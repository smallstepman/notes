** why aging happens
- animals which dont have a lot of predation (dont get eaten) (whales, shares, moles) - they can put their energy into long lasting body
-
** longevity genes
- get turned on by adversity
- mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) - makes a protein that sends an aminoacid
  - after eating a stake it goes "oh a have a log of protein, im gonna build muscles"
** AMPK
- AMP-activated protein kinase
- we want more of it
- we want to activate ampk by fasting
- makes body more sesnitive to insuline
- downregulate mtor when fasting
*** medformin

-
** rapamycin
