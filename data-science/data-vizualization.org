#+title: Data vizualization

* Why
Computer based visualization systems provide visual representations of datasets designed to help people carry out tasks more effectively
** external representation: replace cognition with percetion
** don't need vis when fully automatic solution exists and is trusted
** many analysis problems ill-specified
- don't know exactly what questions to ask in advance
** posibilities
- long-term use for end users (e.g. exploratory analysis of scientific data)
- presentation of know results
- stepping stone to better understanding of requirements before developing models
- help developers of automatic solution refine/debug, determin paramenters
- help end users of automatic solution verify, build trust
