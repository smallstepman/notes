#+title: Rust unsafe

- unsafe code is the mechanism Rust gives developers for taking advantage of [[id:66a20696-fc81-4ef4-bcc4-3158804429a1][invariants]] that, for whatever reason, the compiler cannot check
- unsafe code, is a code that is allowed to make unsafe operations, because developer has figured out its safe to use such code in particural context
- =unsafe= keyword can either
  - mark function as unsafe
  - enables to invoke unsafe functionality
- =unsafe= block allows to
  - dereference raw pointer
  - call unsafe functions (e.g. ffi)
  - access mutable and external static variables
  - access fields of unions

- its a good idea to add =assert= statements in code inside =unsafe= block - panic is better than [[id:eca79387-9149-4816-9ad9-84c0664a9bac][undefinied behaviour]]
