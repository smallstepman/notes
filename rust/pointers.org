* smart pointer
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
A pointer is a general concept for a variable that contains an address
in memory. Reference =&= is the most common pointer in Rust.

*Smart pointers* are pointers with additional capabilities and metadata.

- Smart pointers implements Deref and Drop traits. Deref trait allows an
  instance of the smart pointer struct to behave like a reference. Drop
  trait allows you to customize the code that is run when an instance of
  the smart pointer goes out of scope.
- Additional difference between references and smart pointers is that
  references are pointers that only borrow data; in contrast, in many
  cases, smart pointers own the data they point to.
- String and Vec are both smart pointers because they own the data and
  allow to modify it. They also hold metadata (e.g. vec length) and
  guarantees (String being valid utf8)

- Rust converts =y*= to =*(y.deref())=
- Implicit Deref Coercions with Functions and Methods
- Deref coercion works only on types that implement the Deref trait. Deref coercion converts such a type into a reference to another type. For example, deref coercion can convert &String to &str because String implements the Deref trait such that it returns str. Deref coercion happens automatically when we pass a reference to a particular type's value as an argument to a function or method that doesn't match the parameter type in the function or method definition. A sequence of calls to the deref method converts the type we provided into the type the parameter needs.

#+begin_src rust
fn main() {
    let z = MyBox::new(String::from("Lola"));
    hello(&z);
    hello(&(*z));
    hello(&(*z)[..]);

    // first_word works on slices of `String`s
    let word = first_word(&my_string[..]);

    let my_string_literal = "hello world";

    // first_word works on slices of string literals
    let word = first_word(&my_string_literal[..]);

    // Because string literals *are* string slices already,
    // this works too, without the slice syntax!
    let word = first_word(my_string_literal);

Above will print =Lola= three times, bacause rust is able to call Deref
until it matches parameter's type. This is resolved during compliation.

- How Deref Coercion Interacts with Mutability

  - From =&T= to =&U= when =T=: =Deref<Target=U>=
  - From =&mut= =T= to =&mut U= when =T=: =DerefMut<Target=U>=
  - From =&mut= =T= to =&U= when =T=: =Deref<Target=U>=
  - From =&mut= =T= to =&U= when =T=: =Deref<Target=U>=

    - Conversion from mutable ref to immutable is possible, but that's
      not true for the opposite as it will break borrowing rules.
      Converting an immutable reference to a mutable reference would
      require that initial immutable reference is the only immutable
      reference to that data, but the borrowing rules don't guarantee
      that.

- =Drop= lets me customize what happens when a value is about to go out
  of scope, to e.g. release resource like files or network connection.

- Compiler will insert that code in a place where value is about to go
  out of scope. *As a result, you don't need to be careful about placing
  cleanup code everywhere in a program that an instance of a particular
  type is finished with---you still won't leak resources!* 🙉💛

- The =Drop= trait requires you to implement one method named =drop=
  that takes a mutable reference to =self=

- Variables are dropped in reverse order of their creation

- =Drop= trait is in the prelude, so I don't need to bring it into scope

- it's not straightforward to disable the automatic =drop= functionality

- to manually drop a value, I need to call =std::mem::drop=, which is
  already in the scope under =drop()=

- The =Rc<T>= type keeps track of the number of references to a value
  which determines whether or not a value is still in use.
- If there are zero references to a value, the value can be cleaned up
  without any references becoming invalid.
- Use the =Rc<T>= type when we want to allocate some data on the heap
  for multiple parts of our program to read and we can't determine at
  compile time which part will finish using the data last.
- If I knew which part would finish last, we could just make that part
  the data's owner, and the normal ownership rules enforced at compile
  time would take effect.
- =Rc<T>= is only for use in single-threaded scenarios.
- Use =Rc::clone(&a)= instead of =a.clone()= because implementation of
  =Rc::clone= doesn't make a deep copy of all the data like most types'
  implementations of clone do. The call to =Rc::clone= only increments
  the reference count, which doesn't take much time.
- Via immutable references, =Rc<T>= allows me to share data between
  multiple parts of your program for reading only. If =Rc<T>= allowed to
  have multiple mutable references, it would violate one of the
  borrowing rules discussed in Chapter 4: multiple mutable borrows to
  the same place can cause data races and inconsistencies.
- =strong_count=

  - when count is 0, the value is cleaned up
  - represents ownership relationship

- =weak_count=

  - can be created by calling =Rc:downgrade(&Rc<T>)=, it creates
    instance of type =Weak<T>=
  - they don't express ownership relationship
  - =Rc<T>= type uses =weak_count= to keep track how many =Weak<T>=
    references exist
  - Doesn't have to be 0 for the =Rc<T>= to be cleaned up
  - The value that =Weak<T>= references to might'ev been dropped,
    therefore:

    - To do anything with the referenced value I must make sure it's
      valid
    - To do this, I call =upgrade= method on =Weak<T>= instance, which
      returns =Option<Rc<T>>= (=Some= if value hasn't been dropped,
      =None= if it had been dropped). Rust will ensure =Some=/=None=
      cases are handled, hence no invalid pointer.

- Type that enforces the borrowing rules at runtime instead at compile
  time.
- Interior mutability is a design pattern that allows to mutate data
  even when there are immutable references to that data (normally
  disallowed by borrowing rules)
- =RefCell<T>= represents single ownership over the data in holds.
- The program will =panic= if I break borrowing rules (more than one
  mutable reference, or invalid reference)
- =RefCell<T>= is useful when I'm sure the code follows the borrowing
  rules but the compiler is unable to understand and guarantee that
- =RefCell<T>= is only for use in single-threaded scenarios, and will
  give a compile-time error when used in in multithreaded context
- Because =RefCell<T>= allows mutable borrows checked at runtime, I can
  mutate the value inside the =RefCell<T>= even when the RefCell is
  immutable.

- they dont have lifetimes
- its possible to cast referece into raw pointer outside =unsafe= block
  - reverse is possible only in =unsafe= block

* function pointer comparison
- generally a bad idea
- It is easily possible to get nonsensical behavior in optimized builds, [[https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/54685][example]]

* wide pointers

- place unsized types behind a wide pointer to make a function able to accept trait object or slice as argument ([[id:c3b2d4fe-1fae-48c9-8f8d-dba505e5a8c7][DST]])
- a wide pointer is just like a normal pointer, but it includes an extra word-sized field that gives the additional information about that pointer that the compiler needs to generate reasonable code for working with the pointer
- wide pointer is Sized - it is twice the size of a usize (the size of a word on the target platform): one usize for holding the pointer, and one usize for holding the extra information needed to “complete” the type
  - for a slice, the extra information is simply the length of the slice
  - for a trait object ...
- when taking reference to a DST, the compiler automatically constructs a wide pointer
- =Box= and =Arc= also support storing wide pointers, which is why they both support =T: ?Sized=
