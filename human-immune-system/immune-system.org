#+title: immune system

- macrophages are first line of defense, but are wasted after consuming ~100 bacterias
- neurophils are suicide bommer that arrive next, they sometimes explod leaving toxic sludge of their dna
- after that dendritic cells come and cover themselves with the bacteria, then travell to limbic system to find matching t-cell
- t-cell then replicates itself, and half of it goes to where inflamation is, and half goes to b-cell
- b-cell then produce antibodies which wipe stuff clean
