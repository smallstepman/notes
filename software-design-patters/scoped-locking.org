#+title: scoped locking

- used for acuiring or releasing locks
- useful when I want to avoid forgetting to release the lock
- useful when I want to lock mechanism to protect a critical section (e.g. concurrent access)
- uses scoped semantics of a programming language
- relies on stack unwinding to call the destructor on leaving a scope
- (benefit) increased robustness
- (benefit) simple usage
- (drawback) potential deadlock when used recursively (reacquire lock needed)
- (limitation) language specific semantice - doing a =longjmp= can break stack unwinding semantics (therefore also break scoped locking)
