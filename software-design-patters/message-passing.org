#+title: message passing

- the pattern involves spawning a dedicated task to manage the client resource
  - using this strategy, a single connection is established
- any task that wishes to issue a request sends a message to the client task
- the client task issues the request on behalf of the sender, and the response is sent back to the sender
- the task managing the client is able to get exclusive access in order to call get and set
- the channel works as a buffer
  - operations may be sent to the client task while the client task is busy
  - once the client task is available to process new requests, it pulls the next request from the channel
  - this can result in better throughput, and be extended to support connection pooling.
