#+title: Solid State Drive

- SSD can access any piece of data almost instantaniously

* [[id:e6f46193-d592-46c6-ba2d-76aafbb8b95d][NAND Flash Microchips]]
=Chip:Die:Plane:Block:Page=
** each chip has a stack of dies
*** each dia has two planes
**** each plane is array of vertically stacked charge trap flash memory cells organized into thousands of blocks
***** each block is organized into hundreds of pages
****** each page contains tens of thousands of memory cells
******* each trap flash memory cell can hold 3/4 bits of information
******** TLC - 3 bits- Triple Level Cell
******** QLC - 4 bits - Quad Level Cell
** superpage
same address in each of NAND flash chips.
Results in paralell read/write (extra performance)
* SSD Controller Microchip
Interface between all NAND Flash chips and the PC.
* DRAM Chips
memory buffers, holding lookup tables or translation tables that tell where all the information is stored
* Memory channel
Composed of traces running trough the PCB.
- Reading the address of where data is located and transferring the actual data to write to or read from the nand flash.
- Additional traces are uesd to sending commands to write to read out the information from nand chips

* Wear leveling

* Garbage collection

* Eror-Correction Code
